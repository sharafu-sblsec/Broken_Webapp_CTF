  <h4>The Tale of Kandanpoocha in Jail</h4>
  <p>
    Once upon a tail-flicking afternoon, in the Kingdom of Meowvalon, there lived a legendary feline banker named <strong>Kandanpoocha</strong>. Known across alleyways and attic vaults for founding the majestic <em>poochaBANK</em>, Kandanpoocha handled everything from tuna bonds to sardine securities. But with great fur came great suspicion.
  </p>

  <p>
    One moonlit evening, as the Whisker Moon rose high, royal guards from the <strong>Feline Financial Authority</strong> came storming into poochaBANK. Kandanpoocha was accused of the greatest crime in catconomics history — unauthorized yarn laundering and overfeeding the royal kittens with interest-heavy fish treats.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a puffed tail and proud whiskers, Kandanpoocha meowed, "I did it all for the cats!" But alas, he was sentenced to 7 lives in the Catnip Correctional Castle, a grim place where scratching posts were dull and fish bowls were strictly ornamental.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, behind those metal grates and sleepy-eyed guards, Kandanpoocha began secretly teaching financial wisdom to his fellow feline inmates. He established the first underground litter-ledger, taught tabby-tax evasion awareness, and even ran a secret sardine exchange between 9:00 AM and 2:00 PM (with proper grooming breaks in between).
  </p>

  <p>
    Rumor has it that every full moon, you can still hear his soft meows echoing through the stone halls — "Mewwww meww mewww... diversify your tuna investments..."
  </p>

  <p>
    So the next time you transfer some coins or request a fish loan, remember the sacrifice of Kandanpoocha — the cat who clawed against injustice and got purrsecuted for caring too much.
